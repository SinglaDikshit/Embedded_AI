# Audio Classification

Zero padding - If sample is shorter than uniform decided period os sample then the remaining part is covered by silence, that is called Zero Padding.

MFCC - used to recognize human voice 

PLease refer slides for detailked understanding

CNN architecture - extracted data is passed through CNN layers to extract features automatically 

Layers -> Flatten(Single dimension for decision making)-> Fully Connected -> FC -> Softmax

Input layer -> Reshaping -> CNN layer -> Dropout -> CNN layer -> Dropout -> Flattening -> Output layers

Data Augmentation - generating multiplr variant of a same data point by changing color, angle of picture

Then we will train and evaluate, and we will get the confusion matrix
